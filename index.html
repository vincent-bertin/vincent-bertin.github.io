<b>Abstract:</b> We present experiments to study the relaxation of a nano-scale cylindrical perturbation at one of the two interfaces of a thin viscous free-standing polymeric film. Driven by capillarity, the film flows and evolves towards equilibrium by first symmetrizing the perturbation between the two interfaces, and eventually broadening the perturbation. A full-Stokes hydrodynamic model is presented which accounts for both the vertical and lateral flows, and which highlights the symmetry in the system. The symmetrization time is found to depend on the membrane thickness, surface tension, and viscosity.

<b>Abstract:</b> We present the first direct measurement of the elastohydrodynamic lift force acting on a sphere moving within a viscous liquid, near and along a soft substrate under nanometric confinement. Using atomic force microscopy, the lift force is probed as a function of the gap size, for various driving velocities, viscosities, and stiffnesses. The force increases as the gap is reduced and shows a saturation at small gap. The results are in excellent agreement with scaling arguments and a quantitative model developed from the soft lubrication theory, in linear elasticity, and for small compliances. For larger compliances, or equivalently for smaller confinement length scales, an empirical scaling law for the observed saturation of the lift force is given and discussed.

<b>Abstract:</b> Earth‚Äôs magnetic field is generated by convective motions in its liquid metal core. In this fluid, the heat diffuses significantly more than momentum, and thus the Prandtl number Pr is well below unity. The thermally driven convective flow dynamics of liquid metals are very different from moderate-Pr fluids, such as water and those used in current dynamo simulations. In order to characterise rapidly rotating thermal convection in low-Pr number fluids, we have performed laboratory experiments in a cylinder of aspect ratio ùõ§ = 1.94using liquid gallium (Pr ~ 0.025) as the working fluid. The Ekman number varies from E ~ 5 x 10^-6 to 5 x 10^-6 and the Rayleigh number varies from Ra ~ 2 x 10^5 to 1.5 x 10^7. Using spectral analysis stemming from point-wise temperature measurements within the fluid and measurements of the Nusselt number Nu, we characterise the different styles of low-Pr rotating convective flow. The convection threshold is first overcome in the form of container-scale inertial oscillatory modes. At stronger forcing, sidewall-attached modes are identified for the first time in liquid metal laboratory experiments. These wall modes coexist with the bulk oscillatory modes. At well below the values where steady rotating columnar convection occurs, the bulk flow becomes turbulent. Our results imply that rotating convective flows in liquid metals do not develop in the form of quasisteady columns, as in moderate-Pr fluids, but in the form of oscillatory convective motions. Thus, thermally driven flows in low-Pr geophysical and astrophysical fluids can differ substantively from those occurring in Pr ~ 1 models. Furthermore, our experimental results show that relatively low-frequency wall modes are an essential dynamical component of rapidly rotating convection in liquid metals.

<b>Abstract:</b> A thin liquid film with nonzero curvature at its free surface spontaneously flows to reach a flat configuration, a process driven by Laplace pressure gradients and resisted by the liquid's viscosity. Inspired by recent progresses on the dynamics of liquid droplets on soft substrates, we here study the relaxation of a viscous film supported by an elastic foundation. Experiments involve thin polymer films on elastomeric substrates, where the dynamics of the liquid-air interface is monitored using atomic force microscopy. A theoretical model that describes the coupled evolution of the solid-liquid and the liquid-air interfaces is also provided. In this soft-levelling configuration, Laplace pressure gradients not only drive the flow, but they also induce elastic deformations on the substrate that affect the flow and the shape of the liquid-air interface itself. This process represents an original example of elastocapillarity that is not mediated by the presence of a contact line. We discuss the impact of the elastic contribution on the levelling dynamics and show the departure from the classical self-similarities and power laws observed for capillary levelling on rigid substrates.
